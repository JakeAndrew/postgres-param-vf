{- REFACTOR NOTES
 -
 - SqlPersistT will hopefully go away and somehow refer to the main site.
 -
 - Maybe should probably also go away, since the caller can call (sequence
 - . fmap) themselves. I actually set out to do that, but got clobbered
 - with a type mismatch between "DB" and "ReaderT SqlBackend ..." â€” types
 - that are actually the same.
