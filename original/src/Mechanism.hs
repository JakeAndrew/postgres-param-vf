{- REFACTOR NOTES

 - moneyInfo

     SqlPersistT will hopefully go away and somehow refer to the main site.

     Maybe should probably also go away, since the caller can call
     (sequence . fmap) themselves. I actually set out to do that, but got
     clobbered with a type mismatch between "DB" and "ReaderT SqlBackend
     ..." â€” types that are actually the same.

  - Project and User

     These will have mechanism-specific information, including mapping to
     the master project's entities.

  - fetchUserPledgesDB

     Cut out with a chainsaw; please excuse the mess.
