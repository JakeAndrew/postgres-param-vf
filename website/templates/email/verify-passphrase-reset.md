Hello from [Snowdrift.coop](https://snowdrift.coop)!

Two options to finish resetting your passphrase:

(A) visit <@{AuthR VerifyAccountR}> and paste the following token into the
field:

    #{authToken}

or (B) just follow this link:

    <@?{(AuthR VerifyAccountR, [("v", authToken)])}>

If you don't know what this message is about, don't worry. Nothing has changed,
and nothing will change unless you take one of the actions above.
