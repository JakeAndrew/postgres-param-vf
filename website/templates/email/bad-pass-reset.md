Hello from Snowdrift!

Somebody (probably you) tried to reset a passphrase for an account that
doesn't exist on our site. Since there is no account, nothing happened!

If you would like to create an account, visit
<@{AuthR CreateAccountR}>

If you don't know what this message is talking about, don't worry. Just
ignore it.
