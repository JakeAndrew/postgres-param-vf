      Currently, Snowdrift.coop is operating in a semi-open beta. As we
      develop the crowdmatching mechanism and prepare to support other FLO
      projects, there is one project in particular that is given special
      attention: Snowdrift itself! Enabling one (and only one) project
      allows us to shake out the kinks of the system. Self-sustainability
      and continued work on the mechanism is the goal.

        Pledge to Snowdrift!
      Join the crowdmatching system, see how the system works, and help us
      free the commons.
