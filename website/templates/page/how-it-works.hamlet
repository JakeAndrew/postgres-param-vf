$# .how-it-works/intro which isn't desired.

      <h2>Public Goods
      <p>
        Everyone around the world can freely access, use, modify, and share
        everything we support.
      <p>
        Project categories will include software, music, movies, journalism,
        research, and more. Too often, these things get artificially limited
        technically and/or legally as part of securing funding. Our goal is to
        fund them so that these limitations are no longer needed.
      <p>
        We will verify that all projects at Snowdrift.coop are released as
        public goods under free/libre/open terms.

      <h2>Crowdmatching
      <p>
        Each patron donates a tiny amount times the number of patrons who join
        them in supporting a project. This creates a network effect where
        project supporters work together to fund the results they care about.

      <h2>Sustainability
      <p>
        Ongoing monthly funding gives project teams a sustainable living while
        providing accountability.
