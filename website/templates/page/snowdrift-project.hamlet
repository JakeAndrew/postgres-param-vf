<h1>Project: Snowdrift.coop

<p>
  This very website, Snowdrift.coop, is supported by its own crowdmatching
  mechanism!

<h2>Crowdmatching
<p>
  Snowdrift currently has a crowd of #{projectCrowd project} patrons.
  The current value of a pledge is #{projectPledgeValue project}, and the
  project's monthly income is #{projectMonthlyIncome project}.
  Of course, these numbers will change as the number of patrons changes.

<h2>Pledge
$maybe _ <- muid
  $maybe since <- patronPledgeSince =<< mpatron
    <p>
      You have been pledged to Snowdrift since #{show since}.
    <p>
      If you wish to stop supporting Snowdrift.coop, you can remove yourself
      from the crowd. Your fellow supporters will be sad to see you go!

  <h2>Plans
  <p>
    We are currently working on improved explanations, videos, and web design to
    express the details and importance of our crowdmatching system and the value
    of public goods. We have much work to do finalizing a professional-quality
    user interface for the process not only of pledging but for projects signing
    up for the platform. We also have legal and structural work to do in
    building out the full co-op governance.
  <p>
    For more details on what your donations support, see the
    <a href="https://wiki.snowdrift.coop/planning">planning section of our wiki.

  <h2>Transparency report
  <p>
    Although we hope to add a more standardized report eventually, we maintain a
    wiki page with an
    <a href="https://wiki.snowdrift.coop/operations/accounting">accounting summary
    so patrons can understand how we have used funds in the past and where any
    outside income comes from.
