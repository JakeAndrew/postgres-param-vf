## Main.hs Notes

In Main.hs, our only strings to have type `String` are the commandline
arguments and a few strings in `argCasesTwo`. The rest are either `Text`,
`Line`s, or have type `Turtle.FilePath` This is due to Turtle, a package that
lets us use Haskell somewhat like a shell language. `OverloadedStrings` lets us
have string literals of the aforementioned types.

Please note that we are not using Prelude's `FilePath`, but Turtle's. That
`FilePath` is *not* an alias for `String`, `Text` or `Line`. Instead, it's a
sophisticated structure defined in `Filesystem.Path` and re-exported through
`Turtle`. NB: A `FilePath` may also be a directory path.

* Original idea taken from https://git.gnu.io/snippets/3
* I intentionally did not use `Turtle.Options` nor `optparse-applicative`.
    The autogenerated help text is no good.

* Please do not "manually" add special quotes and/or escape characters to file
paths or other command-line arguments, except for where the Haskell language
requires it in string literals to express special characters. Our helper
functions do their own "pre-treating" of strings where needed, like when
preparing a string for Bash consumption. In our code, Haskell functions actually
*require* "plain" (WYSIWYG) arguments.

* In Main.hs, we limit ourselves to printing through helper functions, except
for the `usageText`, which we print with Turtle's `err`. This limit helps to
ensure correctness, so we hide other ways of printing.
