# [Snowdrift.coop]

Snowdrift is the software that runs the website Snowdrift.coop.

**Snowdrift.coop is a non-profit, cooperative platform for funding public
goods, specifically Free/Libre/Open (FLO) works.**

Rivalrous physical goods and restricted proprietary works use pay-for-access
business models that don't work for public goods. We can only get strong public
goods with a critical mass of public support. Snowdrift.coop builds that support
via a many-to-many matching pledge: Each patron of a FLO project agrees to
donate a little for every patron who donates with them.

For the basic ideas, see our [introduction].

Snowdrift uses the **[Haskell]** programming language **[Yesod web framework]**.
We stick to exclusively FLO resources and tools in all our work.

## Contributing

Snowdrift.coop welcomes contributions of all sorts. Even contributors with no
technical experience can find ways to help. See our [how-to-help] page for more
info about volunteering (including in non-programming ways).

Our **[Contributor guide]** covers all the steps to getting involved with the
Snowdrift code. It includes notes about our development practices, basic setup,
and introductory resources for those new to Git or Haskell or even to
programming generally.
