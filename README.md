# [Snowdrift.coop]

**A non-profit, cooperative platform for funding Free/Libre/Open (FLO) works.**

Using a many-to-many matching pledge, we aim to empower the global
community to better promote freedom-respecting projects of all sorts.

For the basic idea, see our [illustrated intro].

Other pages on the site explain our [mission] and include discussion and
research on issues like the [economics of FLO projects], the [incentives
behind donations], and how our model departs from that of [other funding
sites].

Snowdrift.coop is built with the **[Haskell]** programming language, and
**[Yesod web framework]**.

## Contributing

Snowdrift.coop welcomes contributions of all sorts, and even contributors with
no technical experience can find ways to help. Our [how-to-help page] includes
further notes about the site and info about volunteering (including in
non-programming areas).

We have a complete **[Contributor guide]** covering how to get involved as a
developer. Our guide covers our development practices and all the basic setup
and steps even for those new to Git or Haskell or even to programming generally.

### Building and testing the website

To build the code on your local computer, follow our [Build instructions].

### Filing and searching issues/tickets

For bugs and feature requests, we have a self-hosted [ticket system].

### Communicating with us

Please **ask for help** and/or let us know any confusion you have at any point
